# 🚀 PUBLIC RELEASE: VIRAL-SYNC V4 Mainnet

**Decentralized, Verifiable Attribution without the Web2 Cookies.**

The Viral-Sync V4 Core Protocol is officially compiled, audited locally, and prepared for Solana Mainnet Beta. After 8 weeks of intensive architectural redesign, the era of impenetrable loyalty protocols is here.

## What is Viral-Sync?
Viral-Sync is a Token-2022 Transfer Hook protocol that turns every loyalty token, gym pass, and coffee star into a genealogically-aware tracker. By physically intercepting token transfers, we map exactly who invited who, paying out 100% accurate commissions on-chain, all while fully bypassing Apple tracking prevention, broken referral links, and centralized databases.

## 🛡️ The V4 Advantages
Preceding versions of the protocol succumbed to compute-unit exhaustion, wash-trading, and Mainnet rent costs. Here is how V4 solidifies the foundation:

1. **Graceful Degradation Buffers**: V4 utilizes a 16-slot `InboundBuffer`. If a viral tweet sends thousands of claims to a single wallet at once, the protocol safely catches them, preventing network crashes and ensuring no token ever gets lost.
2. **Merchant Bonds & Auto-Resolution**: Merchants are forced to lock physical SOL into `MerchantBond` PDAs. If a merchant acts negligently or tries to rug-pull, decentralized Watchdogs can raise disputes that auto-resolve in 14 days, slashing the merchant's bond and protecting the consumer.
3. **The Viral Oracle Indexer**: Wash-trading is mathematically eliminated. Our robust Helius-backed Indexer continuously evaluates IP attestations and physical Point-of-Sale NFC geolocation payloads to generate a rigid `suspicion_score`.
4. **Fractional Commission Processing**: Not a single penny is lost. The `CommissionLedger` mathematically stores `dust_tenths` to flawlessly process fractions of a token across limitless referral generations.

## 🧑‍💻 Seamless Web2 UX
Viral-Sync V4 expects normal people to use it.
- **No Gas Fees**: Express.js Relayers seamlessly sign off on your transactions.
- **No Seed Phrases**: The protocol natively supports Privy embedded wallets (Google/Apple login).
- **1-Click X (Twitter) Blinks**: Consumers simply unfurl a Solana Action URL on social media to claim an escrowed loyalty token generated by their friends.

## Getting Started
The Pilot Launch has initialized the Genesis Merchants. SDKs mapping the React Frontend hooks, Express Node relayers, and Mainnet compression Cranks will be open-sourced to the developer community shortly.
