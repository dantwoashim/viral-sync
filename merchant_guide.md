## What Is Viral Sync (For Merchants)?

You spend money on Google Ads, Instagram promotions, and Facebook campaigns. Some of it works, most of it you can't really measure. Viral Sync replaces (or supplements) all of that with one simple idea:

**Pay your customers to bring in new customers.**

Here's how it works:
1. You create a rewards program for your business
2. Customers earn rewards for sharing your business with friends
3. When a new person visits your store and redeems, the referrer automatically earns a commission
4. Everything is tracked, transparent, and verifiable — no disputes about who referred whom

Think of it as **a referral commission system that runs itself**, with no manual tracking, no spreadsheets, and no arguments about who deserves credit.

### Why This Is Better Than Traditional Marketing

| Traditional Marketing | Viral Sync |
|---|---|
| Pay Google $5/click, hope they convert | Pay only when someone actually walks into your store |
| Can't track word-of-mouth | Every referral is tracked from share → visit → purchase |
| Expensive – budget burns fast | You set the commission rate — only pay for results |
| One-dimensional | Multi-generational — Sarah tells Tom, Tom tells Lisa, you reward all of them |
| Opaque | Every transaction is verifiable and auditable |

## Setting Up Your Account (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Sign Up

Go to the Viral Sync merchant portal and sign up with:
- **Google account** (recommended — one tap)
- **Email** (magic link — no password to remember)

That's it. No cryptocurrency purchase, no wallet setup, no seed phrases. Your business account is created automatically.

### Step 2: Name Your Program

Choose a name for your rewards token. This is what your customers will see:

- ☕ **$BREW** — for coffee shops
- 🍕 **$SLICE** — for pizza places
- 💇 **$STYLE** — for salons
- 🎮 **$PLAY** — for gaming lounges

This is just a label — your customers won't know or care that anything blockchain-related is happening.

### Step 3: Set Your Rules

The Settings page lets you configure:

| Setting | What It Means | Recommended Starting Value |
|---|---|---|
| **Commission Rate** | How much referrers earn per redemption (% of reward) | 8–12% |
| **Token Expiry** | How long rewards last before expiring | 90 days |
| **Max Referrals/Day** | Limit per person to prevent gaming | 5 per day |
| **Allow Gen-2 Sharing** | Let referrers' friends also earn (second-generation) | Yes (this is the viral part!) |
| **Min Hold Time** | How long someone must hold rewards before sharing | 1 hour |

Don't overthink these — you can adjust them anytime.

### Step 4: Issue Your First Rewards

Click **"Issue Rewards"** to create your first batch. This is the "inventory" of rewards you're making available. Think of it like printing coupons — except they're digital and self-distributing.

## Your Dashboard

Once you're set up, your merchant dashboard gives you everything at a glance:

### Overview (Home Page)
- **Current Supply** — how many rewards are out there
- **Funnel Chart** — Share → Claim → Redeem conversion rates
- **Recent Activity** — live feed of redemptions and shares
- **Reputation Score** — your trust score (stays high if you run a clean program)

### Viral Oracle
This is your marketing analytics engine:
- **K-Factor** — if this is above 1.0, your program is growing exponentially (each referrer brings more than one new customer)
- **Funnel Rates** — what percentage of people who receive a link actually claim it, and what percentage of claimers actually visit your store
- **Cost per Customer** — how much commission you're paying per new customer (compare this to your Google Ads cost)
- **vs Google Ads Efficiency** — direct comparison showing how Viral Sync stacks up

### Network
A visual map of how your referral network is growing. Each dot is a customer, lines show who referred whom. Green dots are active customers, orange dots are pure referrers.

### Disputes
If something looks suspicious (e.g., someone gaming the system with fake referrals), it shows up here. The system automatically flags unusual patterns, and you can review them.

### Settings
Adjust your commission rates, expiry periods, and referral limits anytime.

## The POS Terminal (In-Store Redemption)

When a customer walks into your store to redeem their rewards, you need a way to process it. The **POS (Point of Sale)** terminal handles this.

### Setup
Open `your-domain.com/pos` on a **tablet** (iPad recommended) and mount it at your counter. It runs in full-screen kiosk mode — no browser chrome, no distractions.

### How It Works
1. The screen shows **"Ready to Scan"** with a pulsing NFC ring
2. Customer taps their phone on the tablet (or shows a QR code)
3. The system verifies the reward in ~2 seconds:
   - ✅ Is this a valid reward?
   - ✅ Is this person at your store? (geo-verification)
   - ✅ Do they have enough balance?
4. **"Redeemed! 🎉"** — shows the amount, customer ID, and referrer commission
5. Screen resets for the next customer automatically

### What Your Cashier Sees
- Customer name/ID (anonymous — just a short code)
- Reward amount being redeemed
- Whether it was a Gen-1 (direct) or Gen-2 (friend-of-friend) referral
- Today's total redemptions and tokens burned

**Your cashier doesn't need any training.** They just wait for the green checkmark.

## How the Money Works

### You Pay Commissions, Not Upfront Costs
- **No monthly fee** — you only pay when results happen
- **Commission comes from rewards you created**, not from your bank account
- Think of it like this: you create 10,000 reward points. When someone redeems 100 points, the referrer might earn 10 points as commission. The cost is baked into the reward structure.

### What "Burning" Means
When a customer redeems a reward, those points are "burned" — destroyed permanently. This is important because it means your reward supply decreases over time, preventing inflation. You issue new rewards when you want to fuel more growth.

## Tracking Your ROI

The **Viral Oracle** page is your ROI command center. Here's how to read it:

### K-Factor (The Most Important Number)
- **K > 1.0**: Your program is self-sustaining. Each referrer brings in more than one new customer. This is exponential growth. 🚀
- **K = 0.5–1.0**: Growing, but not yet viral. Focus on improving your claim rate (make the reward more attractive) or redeem rate (make the in-store experience better).
- **K < 0.5**: Slow start. Consider increasing commission rates or reducing barriers.

### Cost per Customer
Compare this to your Google Ads cost-per-acquisition. If Viral Sync costs $2 per new customer and Google Ads costs $8, you're saving 75%.

### Conversion Funnel
- **Share Rate**: % of customers who share their link (make it easy + rewarding)
- **Claim Rate**: % of recipients who claim the reward (make the link attractive)
- **Redeem Rate**: % of claimers who visit your store (make the reward compelling)

If your **claim rate** is low → your sharing content isn't compelling enough.
If your **redeem rate** is low → your in-store offer isn't attractive enough.

## FAQ for Merchants

**Q: Do I need to buy cryptocurrency?**
A: No. You never buy, sell, or hold any cryptocurrency. All costs are handled in reward points that you create. The underlying technology uses blockchain for transparency and security, but you never interact with it directly.

**Q: Do my customers need crypto wallets?**
A: No. Customers sign in with Google, Apple, or email — just like any other app. A secure account is created for them automatically. They'll never see words like "wallet," "private key," or "blockchain."

**Q: What if someone tries to game the system?**
A: Viral Sync has multiple anti-fraud layers:
- **Geo-verification**: Rewards can only be redeemed at your physical location
- **Rate limiting**: Maximum referrals per person per day
- **Reputation scoring**: Automatic fraud detection flags suspicious patterns
- **Hold periods**: People must hold rewards for a minimum time before sharing (prevents rapid-fire fake referrals)

**Q: What if I want to stop the program?**
A: You can pause or close your program anytime from Settings. There's a cooldown window to allow existing rewards to be redeemed, ensuring fairness to customers who already earned rewards.

**Q: How is this different from a loyalty card program?**
A: Loyalty cards reward repeat visits from the *same person*. Viral Sync rewards bringing *new people*. The two complement each other — keep your loyalty cards for returning customers, use Viral Sync for growth.

**Q: Can I see it working before committing?**
A: Yes. You can run the entire dashboard on devnet (test mode) with simulated data. Nothing is real until you decide to go live.

**Q: How much does it cost to run?**
A: The protocol's transaction fees on Solana are fractions of a penny (typically $0.00025 per transaction). The gas relayer handles these costs — you don't pay them directly or even see them. Your only cost is the commission you choose to offer referrers.
