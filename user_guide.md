## What Is Viral Sync?

You know when you tell a friend about a great coffee shop, and they go? Right now, nobody rewards you for that. Viral Sync changes this.

When a merchant uses Viral Sync, they create a **rewards program** that actually pays you for bringing in new customers. Share a link, your friend visits the shop, and you automatically earn a commission. It's like being a micro-influencer for every local business you love.

**The best part?** You don't need to download a crypto wallet, buy any cryptocurrency, or understand blockchain. It all happens behind the scenes.

## Getting Started (30 Seconds)

### Step 1: Get a Link

You'll receive a rewards link from a merchant or a friend. It looks like a normal link:

```
https://blink.viral-sync.io/refer/brewcoffee?ref=sarah
```

You might get it via:
- 📱 A text message from a friend
- 🐦 A Twitter/X post
- 📲 An NFC tap on a poster in the shop
- 💬 A WhatsApp or Telegram message

### Step 2: Tap the Link

When you tap the link, a card pops up right in your social feed (Twitter, Discord, etc.) — no separate app needed. This is called a **Blink** (Blockchain Link, but you don't need to care about that name).

The card shows:
- The merchant name (e.g., "BREW Coffee")
- How many reward points you'll receive
- A big **"Claim Rewards"** button

### Step 3: Sign Up (One Tap)

Tap **"Claim Rewards"** and you'll be asked to sign in. Pick whichever is easiest:
- **Google** (one tap)
- **Apple** (Face ID / Touch ID)
- **Email** (magic link, no password)

That's it. Behind the scenes, a secure rewards account is created for you instantly. You never see a "wallet address" or "private key" — it's handled automatically, just like how Apple Pay handles your credit card.

### Step 4: Your Rewards Appear

After signing in, you'll see your rewards balance on the Home screen. It shows:
- **Total Earned** — your lifetime earnings
- **Claimable** — rewards ready to use
- **Recent Activity** — a history of everything

## How to Earn

### Share Your Link
Go to the **Earn** tab and you'll see your personal referral link. Share it anywhere:
- Tap **Copy** to paste it into any message
- Tap **Twitter**, **WhatsApp**, or **Telegram** for one-tap sharing

### What Happens When Your Friend Uses It
1. Your friend taps your link
2. They sign up the same way you did (Google/Apple/Email)
3. They receive their own rewards
4. **You automatically earn a commission** — no action needed on your part

### Second-Generation Earnings
Here's where it gets interesting. If your friend shares the link with *their* friend, and that person redeems at the shop — **you earn a smaller commission on that too**. You're building a tree of referrals, and you earn from every branch.

## How to Redeem

### In-Store (NFC Tap)
1. Walk into the merchant's store
2. Open the app on your phone
3. Tap your phone on the **NFC reader** at the counter (it's like tapping Apple Pay)
4. The screen shows **"Redeemed! 🎉"** with your discount applied

### QR Code (Backup)
If NFC isn't available:
1. Open the **Scan** tab
2. Show the QR code on your screen to the cashier
3. They scan it with their POS terminal

### What You See After Redemption
- ✅ A confirmation receipt
- 💰 The reward amount applied
- 📊 Updated activity in your feed

## Your Profile

The **Profile** tab shows:
- **Your balance** (reward points + any earned commissions)
- **Account security** — your account is protected by your Google/Apple/Email login
- **Notifications** — toggle alerts for new commissions, referral activity, etc.
- **Sign Out**

### FAQ for Users

**Q: Do I need cryptocurrency?**
A: No. You never buy, hold, or manage any cryptocurrency. Your rewards are tracked securely and applied automatically.

**Q: Do I need a special wallet app?**
A: No. Everything works through a normal web browser or the Viral Sync app. Your secure account is created automatically when you sign in with Google, Apple, or email.

**Q: How is my account secured?**
A: Your account uses the same security as your Google/Apple account. Behind the scenes, we use enterprise-grade security (MPC — Multi-Party Computation) so no single server ever has full access to your account.

**Q: Can I lose my rewards?**
A: No. Your rewards are recorded permanently and can always be recovered through your Google/Apple/Email login. Even if you lose your phone, just sign in on a new device.

**Q: Is there a fee to earn or redeem?**
A: No. Earning and redeeming are completely free for you. The merchant covers all operational costs.

**Q: What happens to my data?**
A: Your referral activity is recorded on a public ledger (Solana blockchain), but it's tied to an anonymous account ID — not your name, email, or phone number. The merchant sees "Account 7xKX...AsU redeemed 120 points" — not "Sarah Miller redeemed 120 points."
